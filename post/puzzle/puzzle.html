          A team of mathematicians has finally finished off Keller’s conjecture,
          but not by working it out themselves. Instead, they taught a fleet of
          computers to do it for them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Keller’s conjecture, posed 90 years ago by Ott-Heinrich Keller, is a
          problem about covering spaces with identical tiles. It asserts that if
          you cover a two-dimensional space with two-dimensional square tiles,
          at least two of the tiles must share an edge. It makes the same
          prediction for spaces of every dimension — that in covering, say,
          12-dimensional space using 12-dimensional “square” tiles, you will end
          up with at least two tiles that abut each other exactly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the years, mathematicians have chipped away at the conjecture,
          proving it true for some dimensions and false for others. As of this
          past fall the question remained unresolved only for seven-dimensional
          space.
        </p>
        <p>
          But a new computer-generated proof has finally resolved the problem.
          The proof, posted online last October, is the latest example of how
          human ingenuity, combined with raw computing power, can answer some of
          the most vexing problems in mathematics.
        </p>
        <p>
          The authors of the new work — Joshua Brakensiek of Stanford
          University, Marijn Heule and John Mackey of Carnegie Mellon
          University, and David Narváez of the Rochester Institute of Technology
          — solved the problem using 40 computers. After a mere 30 minutes, the
          machines produced a one-word answer: Yes, the conjecture is true in
          seven dimensions. And we don’t have to take their conclusion on faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          The answer comes packaged with a long proof explaining why it’s right.
          The argument is too sprawling to be understood by human beings, but it
          can be verified by a separate computer program as correct.
        </p>
        <p>
          In other words, even if we don’t know what the computers did to solve
          Keller’s conjecture, we can assure ourselves they did it correctly.
        </p>
        <h1>The Mysterious Seventh Dimension</h1>
        <p>
          It’s easy to see that Keller’s conjecture is true in two-dimensional
          space. Take a piece of paper and try to cover it with equal-sized
          squares, with no gaps between the squares and no overlapping. You
          won’t get far before you realize that at least two of the squares need
          to share an edge. If you have blocks lying around it’s similarly easy
          to see that the conjecture is true in three-dimensional space. In
          1930, Keller conjectured that this relationship holds for
          corresponding spaces and tiles of any dimension.
        </p>
        <p>
          Early results supported Keller’s prediction. In 1940, Oskar Perron
          proved that the conjecture is true for spaces in dimensions one
          through six. But more than 50 years later, a new generation of
          mathematicians found the first counterexample to the conjecture:
          Jeffrey Lagarias and Peter Shor proved that the conjecture is false in
          dimension 10 in 1992.
        </p>
        <p>
          A simple argument shows that once the conjecture is false in one
          dimension, it’s necessarily false in all higher dimensions. So after
          Lagarias and Shor, the only unsettled dimensions were seven, eight and
          nine. In 2002, Mackey proved Keller’s conjecture false in dimension
          eight (and therefore also in dimension nine).
        </p>
        <p>
          That left just dimension seven open — it was either the highest
          dimension where the conjecture holds or the lowest dimension where it
          fails.
        </p>
        <p>“Nobody knows exactly what’s going on there,” said Heule.</p>
