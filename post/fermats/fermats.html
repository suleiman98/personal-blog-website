          When Andrew Wiles proved Fermat’s Last Theorem in the early 1990s, his
          proof was hailed as a monumental step forward not just for
          mathematicians but for all of humanity. The theorem is simplicity
          itself — it posits that xn + yn = zn has no positive whole-number
          solutions when n is greater than 2. Yet this simple claim tantalized
          legions of would-be provers for more than 350 years, ever since the
          French mathematician Pierre de Fermat jotted it down in 1637 in the
          margin of a copy of Diophantus’ Arithmetica. Fermat, notoriously,
          wrote that he had discovered “a truly marvelous proof, which this
          margin is too narrow to contain.” For centuries, professional
          mathematicians and amateur enthusiasts sought Fermat’s proof — or any
          proof at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          The proof Wiles finally came up with (helped by Richard Taylor) was
          something Fermat would never have dreamed up. It tackled the theorem
          indirectly, by means of an enormous bridge that mathematicians had
          conjectured should exist between two distant continents, so to speak,
          in the mathematical world. Wiles’ proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem
          boiled down to establishing this bridge between just two little plots
          of land on the two continents. The proof, which was full of deep new
          ideas, set off a cascade of further results about the two sides of
          this bridge.
        </p>
        <p>
          From this perspective, Wiles’ awe-inspiring proof solved just a
          minuscule piece of a much larger puzzle. His proof was “one of the
          best things in 20th-century mathematics,” said Toby Gee of Imperial
          College London. Yet “it was still only a tiny corner” of the
          conjectured bridge, known as the Langlands correspondence.
        </p>
        <p>
          The full bridge would offer mathematicians the hope of illuminating
          vast swaths of mathematics by passing concepts back and forth across
          it. Many problems, including Fermat’s Last Theorem, seem difficult on
          one side of the bridge, only to transform into easier problems when
          shifted to the other side.
        </p>
        <p>
          After Wiles came up with his proof, other mathematicians eagerly
          extended his bridge to slightly larger portions of the two continents.
          But then they hit a wall. There are two natural next directions for
          extending the bridge further, but for both, the Taylor-Wiles method
          faced what seemed like an insuperable barrier.
        </p>
        <p>
          “People wanted to do this for a long time,” said Ana Caraiani of
          Imperial College London. But “we pretty much didn’t think it was
          possible.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, two papers — representing the culmination of the efforts of more
          than a dozen mathematicians — have overcome this barrier, essentially
          solving both problems. Eventually, these findings may help
          mathematicians prove Fermat’s Last Theorem for some number systems
          beyond the positive whole numbers.
        </p>
        <p>
          They are “pivotal results,” said Matthew Emerton of the University of
          Chicago. “There are some fundamental number-theoretic phenomena that
          are being revealed, and we’re just starting to understand what they
          are.”

          One side of the Langlands bridge focuses on some of the least
          complicated equations you can write down: “Diophantine” equations,
          which are combinations of variables, exponents and coefficients, such
          as y = x2 + 6x + 8, or x3 + y3 = z3. For millennia, mathematicians
          have tried to figure out which combinations of whole numbers satisfy a
          given Diophantine equation. They’re motivated primarily by how simple
          and natural this question is, although some of their work has recently
          had unforeseen applications in areas such as cryptography.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since the time of the ancient Greeks, mathematicians have known how to
          find the whole-number solutions to Diophantine equations that have
          just two variables and no exponents higher than 2. But searching for
          whole-number solutions is anything but straightforward with equations
          that have larger exponents, starting with elliptic curves. These are
          equations that have y2 on the left and a combination of terms whose
          highest power is 3, like x3 + 4x + 7, on the right. They’re a
          “massively harder problem” than equations with lower exponents, Gee
          said.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other side of the bridge live objects called automorphic forms,
          which are akin to highly symmetric colorings of certain tilings. In
          the cases Wiles studied, the tiling might be something along the lines
          of M.C. Escher’s famous tessellations of a disk with fish or angels
          and devils that get smaller near the boundary. In the broader
          Langlands universe, the tiling might instead fill a three-dimensional
          ball or some other higher-dimensional space.
