          Animals have evolved to protect against the cold in myriad ways.
          Whales insulate with blubber. Bison congregate near geothermal
          springs. Black bears shelter in caves. And emperor penguins, facing
          Antarctica’s subzero temperatures and gale-force winds, huddle.
        </p>
        <p>
          “A penguin huddle looks like organized chaos,” said François
          Blanchette, a mathematician at the University of California, Merced.
          “Every penguin acts individually, but the end result is an equitable
          heat distribution for the whole community.”
        </p>
        <p>
          It turns out that penguins execute their huddles with a high degree of
          mathematical efficiency, as Blanchette and his team discovered. More
          recently, Daniel Zitterbart, a physicist at Woods Hole Oceanographic
          Institution, helped develop and install high-resolution cameras to
          observe undisturbed huddling behavior. Zitterbart’s team recently
          discovered which conditions cause penguins to huddle, and they are
          investigating the possibility that the penguins’ mathematical behavior
          may reveal secrets about colony health over time.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the bottom of the world, hundreds of thousands of emperor penguins
          emerge from the sea each April to trek over 50 miles to their inland
          colonies. After breeding, the females return to the sea for food and
          the males stay behind, each incubating a solitary egg in a pouch above
          their feet. Without nests or food, they brave the elements by huddling
          together on stable pack ice to maximize ambient heat and minimize
          exposure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though dominant winds can appear to push a huddle along the ice, the
          truth is more nuanced. Blanchette and his team’s model made clear that
          the birds do not move in unison. Penguins in the huddle’s center,
          where temperatures reach a sweltering 100 degrees Fahrenheit, mostly
          stand still. A bird who finds himself on the huddle’s windward side is
          soon driven to relocate to its warmer, leeward side. As more birds
          leave the windward side, penguins in the center soon find themselves
          exposed. In due course, these penguins also depart for the leeward
          side.
        </p>
        <p>
          Huddles typically last a few hours, during which the penguins may
          cycle through multiple rotations from the huddle’s cold exterior to
          its warm interior. In the process, each individual prioritizes his own
          warmth, yet the huddle’s heat is shared by all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Penguins seem to know what mathematicians learned long ago: The
          densest packing of shapes on a plane is a hexagonal grid. According to
          Blanchette’s model, the birds arrange themselves as if they were each
          standing on their own hexagon in a grid. Most huddles start off as
          misshapen blobs. Wind flow and temperature around the huddle prompt a
          first penguin — typically the coldest on the windward side — to
          relocate. This penguin, known as the mover, waddles in search of new
          neighbors in the relative warmth of the huddle’s leeward side.
        </p>
        <p>
          The mover selects the leeward-side boundary penguins with the least
          heat loss as his new neighbors, assuming his new spot without
          disturbing others. (He may or may not choose a spot that maximizes his
          new number of neighbors — in this model, all that matters to him is
          finding the penguins with the least heat loss.) As he settles in, one
          or more of his new neighbors may now be situated in the huddle’s
          interior, without ever having moved. Meanwhile, on the windward side,
          the mover may have exposed a formerly interior penguin to the boundary
          by leaving his old spot vacant.
        </p>
        <p>
          As more penguins embark on heat-seeking missions, the huddle’s
          boundary is in constant flux. Over time, rough shapes in the huddle
          become defined. The original blob transforms into a regular geometric
          object: an oblong shape with straight sides and rounded ends.
        </p>
        <p>
          Without knowing it, the birds have stumbled into an almost perfect
          arrangement. “We tried to think of a better way [penguins could
          huddle], but it always involved an omniscient being who would tell
          them where to go,” Blanchette said.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what prompts penguins to huddle in the first place? To
          investigate, Zitterbart’s team designed and installed a robust,
          remote-controlled observatory in Atka Bay and developed a software
          package that helps them interpret the data. Work from this observatory
          supplements observations by on-site researchers and has allowed
          Zitterbart’s team to develop mathematical models that accurately
          forecast penguin huddles.
