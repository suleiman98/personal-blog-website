          It took Lisa Piccirillo less than a week to answer a long-standing
          question about a strange knot discovered over half a century ago by
          the legendary John Conway.

          In the summer of 2018, at a conference on low-dimensional topology and
          geometry, Lisa Piccirillo heard about a nice little math problem. It
          seemed like a good testing ground for some techniques she had been
          developing as a graduate student at the University of Texas, Austin.
        </p>
        <p>
          “I didn’t allow myself to work on it during the day,” she said,
          “because I didn’t consider it to be real math. I thought it was, like,
          my homework.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The question asked whether the Conway knot — a snarl discovered more
          than half a century ago by the legendary mathematician John Horton
          Conway — is a slice of a higher-dimensional knot. “Sliceness” is one
          of the first natural questions knot theorists ask about knots in
          higher-dimensional spaces, and mathematicians had been able to answer
          it for all of the thousands of knots with 12 or fewer crossings —
          except one. The Conway knot, which has 11 crossings, had thumbed its
          nose at mathematicians for decades.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before the week was out, Piccirillo had an answer: The Conway knot is
          not “slice.” A few days later, she met with Cameron Gordon, a
          professor at UT Austin, and casually mentioned her solution.
        </p>
        <p>
          “I said, ‘What?? That’s going to the Annals right now!’” Gordon said,
          referring to Annals of Mathematics, one of the discipline’s top
          journals.
        </p>
        <p>
          “He started yelling, ‘Why aren’t you more excited?’” said Piccirillo,
          now a postdoctoral fellow at Brandeis University. “He sort of freaked
          out.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “I don’t think she’d recognized what an old and famous problem this
          was,” Gordon said.
        </p>
        <p>
          Piccirillo’s proof appeared in Annals of Mathematics in February. The
          paper, combined with her other work, has secured her a tenure-track
          job offer from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that will
          begin on July 1, only 14 months after she finished her doctorate.

            It’s really [three- and four-dimensional shapes] that are exciting
            for me, but the study of these things is deeply linked with knot
            theory.

          The question of the Conway knot’s sliceness was famous not just
          because of how long it had gone unsolved. Slice knots give
          mathematicians a way to probe the strange nature of four-dimensional
          space, in which two-dimensional spheres can be knotted, sometimes in
          such crumpled ways that they can’t be smoothed out. Sliceness is
          “connected to some of the deepest questions in four-dimensional
          topology right now,” said Charles Livingston, an emeritus professor at
          Indiana University.
        </p>
        <p>
          “This question, whether the Conway knot is slice, had been kind of a
          touchstone for a lot of the modern developments around the general
          area of knot theory,” said Joshua Greene of Boston College, who
          supervised Piccirillo’s senior thesis when she was an undergraduate
          there. “It was really gratifying to see somebody I’d known for so long
          suddenly pull the sword from the stone.”
