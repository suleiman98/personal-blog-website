        <p>
          Donald Knuth is a computer scientist who came of age with his field.
          During the nascent years of computer programming in the middle of the
          last century, a candy company ran a contest that summoned his talents
          as a 13-year-old. The contest asked kids to determine how many words
          could be made from the letters of the candy’s name: Ziegler’s Giant
          Bar. It was a well-defined problem with distinct pieces, just the kind
          he loved.
        </p>
        <p>
          “I had an obsessive-compulsive streak that drew me to digital,
          discrete problems. And I loved poring over large collections of
          information,” Knuth said.
        </p>
        <p>
          Knuth methodically leafed through his family’s 2,000-page Funk &
          Wagnalls unabridged dictionary in the basement. He even convinced his
          parents he was sick, winning himself two weeks away from school to
          work on the problem. After labeling index cards with headings such as
          “Aa,” “Ab” and “Ba” based on the beginnings of possible words using
          letters from the candy’s name, he went down the dictionary’s columns
          noting words that qualified. He found that he could skip entire
          sections of the dictionary, such as pages for words starting with the
          letter “C,” or sections of the “B” words whose second letter was “U.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The contest officials had identified approximately 2,000 words they
          could expect, but Knuth found more than 4,700. He was rewarded with a
          spot on television and chocolate for his entire class. He would go on
          to win many more accolades, including the first ACM Grace Murray
          Hopper Award, the National Medal of Science and the A.M. Turing Award.
        </p>
        <p>
          Knuth eventually merged his dual loves of discrete digital problems
          and large collections of information in his magnum opus, The Art of
          Computer Programming — a book series he began writing as a graduate
          student in 1962 and has yet to complete. He published volume 1 in
          1968, and the current version is in its 42nd printing. Volume 2
          followed in 1969 and volume 3 in 1973. By then he was a computer
          science professor at Stanford University, but he worried that his work
          would prevent him from completing his books. So he took a leave of
          absence in 1990 and then retired in 1993 to spend the rest of his life
          completing the seven-volume set. Now 82, he’s hard at work on part B
          of volume 4, and he anticipates that the book will have at least parts
          A through F.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Art of Computer Programming is more than a how-to manual. Just as
          Isaac Asimov and Eric Temple Bell wove narratives and characters into
          their science and math stories, Knuth delights in telling stories of
          computer science.
        </p>
        <p>
          “The best way to communicate from one human being to another is
          through story,” he said.
        </p>
        <p>
          This passion for communication helped him play another starring role
          in the story of computer science beyond his magnum opus. When his
          publisher sent him galley proofs for the second edition of volume 2 in
          the 1970s, Knuth was disturbed by the arrangement and appearance of
          the numbers, symbols and words on the pages. He flew to Los Angeles to
          see a machine that printed glossy magazines digitally, hoping it could
          provide aesthetic relief, but it was too expensive. Nonetheless, on
          that trip he began developing a computer language that would allow him
          to typeset mathematics digitally.
        </p>
        <p>
          Back at Stanford, Knuth put aside The Art of Computer Programming for
          nearly a decade to develop TeX (pronounced “tech”), a sophisticated,
          game-changing program that put digital typography on a desktop
          computer. He made it open source, much to the benefit of professional
          mathematicians, computer scientists, economists, engineers, linguists,
          statisticians and anyone else who lacked technical symbols on their
          keyboards but understood the placement of complicated formulas better
          than their publishers. In a world of often ephemeral computer
          programs, TeX has endured as the gold standard for making scientific
          papers more beautiful and easier for experts to read and understand.
        </p>
        <p>
          Knuth’s interest in storytelling also led him to develop a philosophy
          of literate programming — a method for writing computer programs as
          literary essays. A literate program intersperses source code with
          elegant prose written in a familiar language, such as English. The
          source code delivers functionality and efficiency, while the
          exposition addresses a human reader, rather than the computer’s
          compiler. Anyone who later updates or debugs a literate program will
          avoid the often time-consuming and costly problem of trying to
          understand the original programmer’s algorithms, design decisions and
          implementation strategies. Knuth is a computer scientist who
          understands that words matter.
